Normally in any Sabbath service there is a moment called "The Garden of Prayer", in this time people are handled a mic to tell the congregation what they want the church to pray baout, it could be about health, about work, about family, the prayers are endless. Now, there is a person on the pulpit how is writting down all the prayers request so the leaders of the church can have a document where they can see all the prayers request they have to pray about in that particualr week.

With Kafka-Pray the moment the writter writes down theirs prayer requests, individuals will see their prayer requests in the projector of the church so they know for certain that that pray will be pray about by the church.

Kafka-Pray is a web application that allows users to submit prayer requests, which are then processed and stored using Apache Kafka and Amazon S3. This application consists of a Flask web server that handles prayers request for a Sabbath service, a Kafka producer for submitting messages, a Kafka consumer for processing messages and showing them, and an integration with Amazon S3 for long-term storage. Additionally, stored prayer requests can be queried using SQL in AWS Athena.
