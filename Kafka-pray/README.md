Kafka-Pray is a web application that allows users to submit prayer requests, which are then processed and stored using Apache Kafka and Amazon S3. This application consists of a Flask web server that handles prayers request for a Sabbath service, a Kafka producer for submitting messages, a Kafka consumer for processing messages and showing them, and an integration with Amazon S3 for long-term storage. Additionally, stored prayer requests can be queried using AWS Athena.
